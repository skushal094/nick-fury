# Assumptions Made

* Emotion is felt at the time of object creation
* message is sent at the time of creation
* While storing emotion, only the category of the feeling is stored
* One client has only one journal
* For mapping, client does not need approval from therapist. However, Therapist need approval from client to be mapped.
* Only when there exists an active mapping, users will be allowed to send or view messages.
* when seeing messages, old messages will be shown too. (i.e. those messages that were exchanged before current active mapping.)
* When therapists create sessions, they do not need approval from client. However, client need one.
