## Journalling for therapy

The pandemic, COVID-19, requires people to practice social distancing. Many are quarantined at home or at temporary facilities. In the light of the new social dynamics, people experience feelings of isolation which potentially have an impact on mental health. Therapy, once taboo, is starting to be acceptable in society. However, there are a few problems therapists and clients may face while engaging for therapy during this period of isolation –


1. Clients may face several emotions between therapy sessions. These crucial data points are inaccessible, and available only from memory recall.
2. Clients cannot seamlessly switch between therapists, or engage with more than one.
3. Therapists maintain notes and mind maps based on their interactions with clients. With growing clientele, managing these becomes challenging.

As a simple solution for the clients and the therapist, we need an app:
* For clients to maintain their **emotions journal**
* For therapists 
    * To view journals (authorised by clients) 
    * For making their own notes

The app must cover these stories –

*   A Client should be able to …   
    *   Approve or reject a therapist’s request for access to Client emotions journal.
    *   Client should be able to accept or reject mapping requests from therapists.
    *   Request for an appointment in an available slot
    *   Run keyword search across Therapists’ notes and emotions journals.
*   A Therapist should be able to …
    *   Approve or Reject session request from clients.
    *   Create a new session (therapy appointment). Each session with –
        *   Private notes, visible only to the therapist
        *   Shared notes with the client. For any assignments. 
        *   Request a new client for journal access. 
    *   Modify details of each session
    *   Run keyword search across customers, notes and emotions journals.
